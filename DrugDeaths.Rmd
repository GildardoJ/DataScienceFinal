```

## Introduction


```{r cars}

d = read.csv("Accidental_Drug_Related_Deaths_2012-2018.csv")
dats = read.csv("C:/Users/gilda/Documents/CSUMBSpring2019/CST383/Final_Project/chsi_dataset/RISKFACTORSANDACCESSTOCARE.csv")



```

## Data exploration



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

par(mfrow= c(1,2))
plot(table(d$Age[d$Heroin != "Y"]), xlab = "Age", ylab = "number of deaths without Heroin", main = "Number of deaths by age", col = "green")
plot(table(d$Age[d$Heroin == "Y"]), xlab = "Age", ylab = "number of deaths with Heroin", main = "Number of deaths by age", col = "red4")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
